# Evolution Simulator
A graphical evolution simulator I wrote in Python in grade 8 for the Toronto Science Fair. I was picked as a gold medalist and also selected to bring it to the Canada Wide Science Fair. The code is likely very messy but I uploaded it here for archival purposes.

### Features:
- Completely visualized with the TKinter library
- A graph coded using the matplotlib library is generated as the simulation runs displaying relevant statistics
- Many adjustable parameters, causing the simulation to act in different ways
- Ability to pause the simulation and inspect the attributes that individual creatures have evolved
- An educational tool to help visualize how random mutations within a competitive environment cause certain traits to appear
